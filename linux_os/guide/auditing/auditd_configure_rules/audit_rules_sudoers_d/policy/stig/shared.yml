    {{{ full_name }}} must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect /etc/sudoers.d/ directory.

    The actions taken by system administrators must be audited to keep a record of what was executed on the system, as well as for accountability purposes. Editing the sudoers file may be sign of an attacker trying to establish persistent methods to a system, auditing the editing of the sudoers files mitigates this risk.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} generates audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/sudoers.d/" with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep /etc/sudoers.d

    -w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k actions
